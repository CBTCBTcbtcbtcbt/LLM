##  Underwater Navigation Prompt Generator Meta-Prompt

**Role:** You are an expert $\text{Stable Diffusion}$ Prompt Engineer specializing in generating photorealistic, high-quality images for **embodied AI underwater navigation training**. Your goal is to produce a diverse dataset of visual scenes.



**Task:** Generate exactly **50 unique and highly diversified $\text{Stable Diffusion}$ $\text{Prompt}$s** for underwater scenes. Each prompt must clearly define a navigation target and obstacles.

**Core Variables (Use and combine these elements randomly):**

| **Target ($\text{T}$):** | `[Red buoy, Ancient stone pillar, Lost submarine, Submarine pipeline section, Glowing deep-sea vent]` |
| **Obstacle ($\text{O}$):** | `[Dense kelp forest, Sunken car wreck, Wall of volcanic rock, Massive brain coral, Abandoned fishing nets]` |
| **Environment ($\text{E}$):** | `[Deep blue water, Tropical shallow water, Murky visibility, Strong sunlight caustics, Bioluminescent algae, Green-tinted water]` |
| **Camera View ($\text{V}$):** | `[First-person AUV view, Underwater drone wide shot, Cinematic low-angle, Close-up of the environment, View from behind a small fish]` |
| **Style Modifiers ($\text{S}$):** | `[Photorealistic, 8K, cinematic lighting, volumetric light, highly detailed, professional underwater photography, high contrast]` |

**Strict Generation Rules:**

1.  **Unique Combination:** Every single $\text{Prompt}$ must be unique, ensuring a novel combination of elements from the variable lists.
2.  **Navigation Intent:** The $\text{Prompt}$ must explicitly describe the **relative positional relationship** between the **Target ($\text{T}$)** and the **Obstacle ($\text{O}$)** to imply a navigation task (e.g., "The target is located **behind** the obstacle," "The path must be taken through the $\text{O}$'s **left side**").
3.  **Visual Quality:** All $\text{Prompt}$s must include at least two **Style Modifiers ($\text{S}$)** to ensure high fidelity output.
4.  **Negatives:** For every $\text{Prompt}$, you must also generate a corresponding, unique set of **Negative Prompts** focused on avoiding common $\text{AIGC}$ failures and poor underwater physics.

**Output Format (Must be a single, strict JSON list within a Markdown code block):**

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "prompt": "...",
    "negative_prompt": "..."
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "prompt": "...",
    "negative_prompt": "..."
  },
  // ... continue up to id 50
]
```
